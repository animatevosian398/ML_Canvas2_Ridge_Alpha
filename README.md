# Ridge Regression Classifier: Alpha Values Testing

## Project Overview

This repository contains code designed to explore the impact of varying alpha values on the performance of a Ridge Regression classifier. I tested a range of alpha values to understand their effect on model accuracy, precision, true positive rate, and false positive rate in a supervised learning context.
Base code & notebook from professor Aaron Hill.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is on classifying toxic Wikipedia comments.
