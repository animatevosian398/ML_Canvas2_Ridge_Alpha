# Ridge Regression Classifier: Alpha Values Testing

## Project Overview

This repository contains code designed to explore the impact of varying alpha values on the performance of a Ridge Regression classifier. Through systematic experimentation, we test a range of alpha values to understand their effect on model accuracy, precision, true positive rate (TPR), and false positive rate (FPR) in a supervised learning context.

## Key Objectives

- To evaluate how different alpha values influence the Ridge Regression classifier's performance metrics on both training and test datasets.
- To identify the alpha value that optimizes the model's ability to generalize to unseen data, with a focus on maximizing accuracy and precision while balancing the TPR and FPR.
